        <h3>Purpose of Is It Up?</h3>
        <p>Is It Up? was developed to help internet users having trouble getting to their favorite
            websites with finding out if that website is having issues and currently down. Please
            test it out and contact us with any issues.
        </p>
        <h3>How To use the Search Engine.</h3>
        <p>The use of the search engine was designed to be as simple as possible. Just
            type in the website you are trying to find out if it is down or not and either
            hit enter on your keyboard or the submit query button to get the results.
